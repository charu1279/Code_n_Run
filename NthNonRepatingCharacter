/*The program must accept a string S and an integer N as the input. The program must print the Nth non-repeating character as the output.

Note: The string contains at least N non-repeating characters.

Boundary Condition(s):
3 <= Length of string S <= 100
1 <= N <= 26

Input Format:
The first line contains the value of string S.
The second line contains the value of N.

Output Format:
The first line contains the Nth non-repeating character.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
HELLO
3

Output:
O

Explanation:
N = 3, the first non-repeating character is H.
The second non-repeating character is E.
The third non-repeating character is O.
Hence O is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
aaaaabbbcdfecdpqpq
2

Output:
e
