/*The program must accept a string S as the input. The program must print YES if all the alphabets in the string S have the same frequency. Else the program must print NO as the output.
Note: String S contains only lower-case alphabets.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= Length of String <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains the string S.

Output Format:
The first line contains either YES or NO.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
venom

Output:
YES

Explanation:
The frequency for the alphabet 'v' is 1
The frequency for the alphabet 'e' is 1
The frequency for the alphabet 'n' is 1
The frequency for the alphabet 'o' is 1
The frequency for the alphabet 'm' is 1
Here all the alphabets have the same frequency 1
Hence the output YES is printed.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
better

Output:
NO

Explanation:
The frequency for the alphabet 'b' is 1
The frequency for the alphabet 'e' is 2
The frequency for the alphabet 't' is 2
The frequency for the alphabet 'r' is 1
Here the alphabets 'b' and 'r' have the frequency 1, but the alphabets 'e' and 't' have the frequency 2
Hence the output NO is printed.
