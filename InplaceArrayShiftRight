/*You must implement the function shiftRight which accepts an array arr and shifts the values in-place to the right.
That is the array arr must be modified to reflect the shifted values. N represents the size of the array arr.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
10 20 30 40 50

Output:
50 10 20 30 40

Explanation:
Each value is shifted to it's right.
10 is moved to the position of 20, 20 to 30, 30 to 40, 40 to 50.
The last element 50 as it does not have any value to the right, it is moved to the first position (that is to the position of 10).

*/

void shiftRight(int arr[], int N){
    int temp=arr[N-1];
    for(int i=N-1;i>0;i--){
        arr[i]=arr[i-1];
    }
    arr[0]=temp;
    return arr;
}
